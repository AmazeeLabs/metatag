Metatag Context
---------------
The purpose of this module is to provide a Metatag reaction for Context [1]
conditions, thus allowing meta tags to be assigned to specific paths.

It also provides:
* an interface that integrates with the Metatag module.
* support for tokens.

Configuration can be done via the normal Context UI module or the new admin
page available at: admin/config/search/metatags/context

This module is based on the Context Metadata [2] module. The initial work was
developed by Marcin Pajdzik [3] and sponsored by Dennis Publishing [4].
